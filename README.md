## Background

This part of the master thesis project by Gustaf Brostr√∂m and David Carpenfelt [Robust Perception for Formula Student Driverless Racing](https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/9069372).
Made for the Lund Formula Student 2021 autonomous racing vehicle to accurately detect and classify cones on a racing track.

## Contents

The code relies heavily on the order of the data read from a 3D lidar to quickly perform ground removal and clustering algorithms.

The code consists of a novel ground removal algorithm described in the paper.
A novel clustering method dubbed *String Clustering* and classification methods to distinguish between blue/yellow and big/small cones.
